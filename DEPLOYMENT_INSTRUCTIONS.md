# Deployment Instructions

I have configured the backend to run with a production-ready server (waitress).
However, I am unable to start the server myself due to security restrictions.

To start the backend server, please run the following command in your terminal:

```
python "c:\Users\mnima\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\ETTI JAVA PROJECT\flask_app\app.py"
```

The backend will be available at http://localhost:5000

Regarding the frontend, the `web-project` directory appears to contain a separate, standalone frontend that is not currently integrated with the Flask backend. The Flask application is serving its own user interface.
